# IOS-Swift-UIFontTextStyle
``` Level : Intermediate ```

With Dynamic Types the user can specify the preferred text size in the Settings app of the device. Modern applications are expected to adjust text to the preferred size. Instead of setting the font size explicitly in the code, you can make use of the preferred font for a given text syle. In this tutorial some labels will be created, which will respond to the preferred text size. This tutorial is made with Xcode 10 and built for iOS 12. (General -> Accessibility -> Larger Text.)
